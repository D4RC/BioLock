# BioLock
BioLock is a barebones package that allows the reading of RFID NFC Chips, more so based around Mifare Classic & Mifare Ultralight(xNT Implants and so on) entirely in javascript with minimal input from external languages other than module readers and so on.

## Requirements
* Arduino UNO

* PN532 compatible NFC Reader

## Node Modules

* serialport
* fs
* path


Inspiration was taken from https://github.com/lanhed/nfc-unlock but it retains alot of redundent code not needed to really make an application like this feasable.
